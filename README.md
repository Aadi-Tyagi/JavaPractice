# JavaPractice

## Week 1: 

Exercise 1:  
Create a program that will populate and print array a = [5,7,6,9,8,1,-15,2,6] and calculate sum 

Exercise 2:  
Create a program that will calculate avg. sum for array a = [5,7,6,9,8,1,-15,2,6]

Exercise 3:  
Create array c from arrays a and b using this formula. Create separate method for max and for calculating c

Exercise 4:  
For String “Welcome to Clarivate!” create a method which will calculate length of String.

Exercise 5:  
Create a CSV file with mentor/mentee table mentioned above.
- a. The program will read this csv file.
- b. It will ask an input from user
- c. After the user enters any character, the program will search if mentee contains this character, and shows the name of mentors.
- d. For example, if user enter the character “a”, program shows all mentors name since all the mentees have the character “a” in the name. If user enter the character “bo”, program will show only aleksandar.mladenovic@clarivate.com since only boby.kumari@clarivate.com has the characters “bo” in the name.
- e. Add verification if the entered email addresses are indeed “Clarivate” email and it is correct mail formatting. “aaaa@gmail” is not a valid email since, it doesn’t have “.com” or any other domain name at the end. Use regex to check the email.

## Week 2:

Exercise 1:  
Create a BankAccount class where each account has an associated balance. Implement a constructor that allows you to set an initial balance when creating an account. For instance, you can create an account with $1000 initial balance or another with a default $0 balance.  
Example:
- Create an account with an initial balance of $1000.
- Create an account with a default initial balance of $0.

Exercise 2:  
Create a Shape class that can represent different geometrical shapes. Each shape has a name and a color. You can create shapes like circles or rectangles with specific names and colors.  
Example:
- Create a red circle.
- Create a blue rectangle.

Exercise 3:   
Design a set of classes to handle different shapes. There is a base class called Shape which has methods to calculate the area and perimeter. Derive classes like Circle, Rectangle, and Triangle from Shape. Each derived class will have specific methods to calculate its area and perimeter.  
Example:
- Calculate the area and perimeter of a circle with radius 5.
- Calculate the area and perimeter of a rectangle with length 4 units and width 6 units.

Exercise 4:  
Define an interface named Drawable that has a method called draw(). Implement this interface in classes like Circle, Rectangle, and Triangle. This will allow you to draw each shape using the same method.  
Example:
- Draw a circle.
- Draw a rectangle.
- Draw a triangle.

Exercise 5:  
Create a package structure for an e-commerce system. Inside, define classes like Product, Customer, Order, and ShoppingCart. You can create example instances of these classes to represent products, customers, orders, and shopping carts.  
Example:
- Add a product named "Product A" with a price of $100.0.
- Create a customer named "John Doe".
- Place an order for customer "John Doe".

Exercise 6:  
Develop an abstract class named Employee which contains attributes like name and salary, and a method calculateSalary(). Subclass this abstract class to create Manager and Developer classes, and implement the calculateSalary() method in each subclass.  
Example:
- Create a manager named "Alice" with a salary of $80,000.
- Create a developer named "Bob" with a salary of $60,000.

Exercise 7:  
Design an abstract class named Shape with methods to calculate the area and perimeter. Create subclasses like Circle, Rectangle, and Triangle to implement these methods according to the specific shape.  
Example:
- Calculate the area and perimeter of a circle with radius 5.
- Calculate the area and perimeter of a rectangle with length 4 units and width 6 units. 

Exercise 8:  
Define an interface named SortingAlgorithm with methods representing different sorting algorithms like bubble sort, merge sort, and quicksort. Implement this interface in separate classes.  
Example:
- Implement the bubble sort algorithm.
- Implement the merge sort algorithm.
- Implement the quicksort algorithm.  

Exercise 9:  
Create a Logger interface with methods for logging messages at various levels like info, warning, and error. Implement this interface in classes for logging to the console, a file, and a database.  
Example:
- Log an informational message.
- Log a warning message.
- Log an error message.
